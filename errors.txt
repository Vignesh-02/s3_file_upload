1. Rollback incomplete error
Delete the aws cloudformtion stack as it results in an endless loop
2. Plugin serverless-iam-roles-per-function
    Remove the plugin and it still works(this is a quick fix might cause error later)
3. Fixing status 502 bad gateway
    Caused by improper response object in s3 upload object in upload.js 
    Fixed by changing status to statusCode.
